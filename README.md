## âœ… Steps Covered

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Converted categorical diagnosis labels (M/B â†’ 1/0)
3. Performed train-test split
4. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
5. Trained logistic regression model using `sklearn`
6. Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
7. Plotted:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve
   - Sigmoid Function
